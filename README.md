# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a digital showcase of my journey as a designer and developer. This project is built with React and Vite, combining performance with elegant design.

## About Me

My journey began at 10 with painting and sketching, evolving from paper to pixels. Today, I channel that passion into digital design and development, combining creativity with code. My design approach balances aesthetics and usability, while development focuses on performance and interactivity.

Currently, I work as a Web Developer and Designer at Finbiznet, building a startup website that merges innovation with user-focused design. I also recently completed a freelance UI/UX project for an astrological app, where I crafted intuitive interfaces and seamless user experiences.

Every project I take on reflects my commitment to thoughtful design and clean, maintainable code, transforming ideas into engaging digital experiences.
